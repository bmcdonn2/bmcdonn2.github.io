Happy Easter everyone! Trying to imagine what my 5-years-in-the-past self would think if I told him he'd be eating take-out on Easter. I'm sure the old me would have a lot of questions but if I got to tell him the spread he would see that it wasn't the meal that was the sad part of the situation.

We ordered from [The Reservoir](https://www.reservoirchicago.com/), only a short, pleasant walk from our place. We visited there as a family this past fall and had a great time. It was the scene of this infamous set of back-to-back shots where Oscar tried to make claim to _my_ beer.

In the spirit of trying to support our local business, we purchased the $100 Easter special. This included:

- Hummus Platter w/ Pita
- Charcuterie Platter ($7 surcharge)
- Caesar Salad
- Chicken Vesuvio
- Cavatappi Pasta
- Mashed Potatoes & Gravy
- Roasted Vegetables
- Dinner Rolls
- Bread Pudding
- Key Lime Pie
- Bottle of Sparkling Wine (Charles De Fere Brut?)[^1]

This was sold as a meal for 4-6 people and boy they weren't lying. Here's what _only_ the entrees and sides looked like:

Going into the weekend I was certain I'd cook something but when I learned this all was on the way I knew I had to abandon that plan.

## Oscar Updates

It's been weeks since Oscar has seen anyone but his parents so he was lucky to see both sets of grandparents in the flesh over the past weekend. In both cases (mostly) strict social distancing was enforced.

First up, Oscar got to see the Gunderson grandparents outside our nearest elementary school on good Friday. He got to show off his stroller pushing skills and enjoy some bubbles. 

For his efforts his grandparents presented a wonderful Easter basket including a board book in the shape of a Tractor. The book proved invaluable for calming the babe when he was forced into his stroller after the visit.

On Saturday he got to visit with the McDonnell grandparents at Gill Park. While the little man has started to show impatience with stale bedtime books, he was more than happy to display his stroller-pushing and bubble-admiration for the second consecutive day. These things have not grown old, especially with a fresh audience!

Grandparents Kevin & Susan likewise provided an ample Easter Basket for grandchilden and parents alike. Highlights for Oscar here were a new musical toy. His parents welcome the addition of all new melodic noise-making devices.

Once we make it through our backlog of food I'll be back on the burners!
