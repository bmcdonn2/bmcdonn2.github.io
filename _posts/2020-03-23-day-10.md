## Get Down with the Sickness

Been a bit quiet on here the last few days because I've been feeling a bit under the weather. Given that we're in the middle of a pandemic, this has me a bit anxious.

### Illness Timeline

I started to feel a little _off_ on Thursday night but I had chalked that up to the new daily grind of work in the morning and baby-minding in the afternoon.

The feeling that I wasn't 100% persisted into Friday and mainly manifested itself as fatigue, again something I thought was due to adjusting to the new way of life.

When I woke up on Saturday there was no mistaking that I had caught something. The fatigue remained but now I had a nice headache to go with it.

The situation did not improve much on Sunday.

As of today, Monday, I think I'm feeling a bit better. The headache is diminishing a bit and I'm feeling less tired.

Rachel has been a tremendous help during this time by basically taking over 100% of baby duties to let me rest. If this is indeed COVID-19, there's no real remedy other than letting the body do its thing and she's been doing everything she can to let my body do that.

### Could it be?

This of course raises the question, how likely is it that it is COVID-19? 

Well, the last time I ventured outside for something other than a walk around the block was on March 13th to get some lunch at Whole Foods. I only picked up a soup and some beer and tried my best to social distance. Six days later was the first time I felt any presence of symptoms. The timing is consistent but I won't know for sure unless this thing takes a turn, at least with testing being in such a sorry state.

Anyway, it's not my intent to scare anyone on this, but part of my writing this blog is to document the times and there would be quite the gap if I omitted this part!

## Oscar Update

As I've said, Rachel's been doing the lion's share of watching Oscar. Tonight she made us dinner along with some mac & cheese for the little one. 

A real Super Mom!

## Things Cooked

Nothing new today. Steven the sourdough starter is looking like he's almost ready for business though. I'm seeing a lot of activity after each feeding so it's almost time to start making bread!

## Politics

If you haven't gathered this from my previous posts, there is a left-tilt to the political talk here. That is not an accident. Some day I might flesh out how I arrived at this worldview so stay tuned!

Anyway, on to the content!

### Bailouts

Lots of talk in the past couple of days about bailouts. This pandemic is obviously taking a major toll on businesses both large and small and the only force that can possibly soften the blow is the good ol' US Government. That mechanism for support is a bailout, but how best to execute the bailout?

Here's a neat graphic that breaks down the debate.

Now this graphic comes from a liberal think tank so take that into account while reading this but I think it does a good job categorizing the types of relief we're looking for at this moment in time. 

It's the last row that has generated the most controversy. That Senate bill from last night allows the bailouts to be applied unconditionally. This is something Democrats and the Left don't like because it means a company, say a casino, could receive a bailout then layoff 30% of their staff. Not really in the spirit of bailing out that casino right?

What do the Democrats want instead? Well, they want conditions attached to those bailouts. Things like requirements to retain staff, restricting stock buybacks, things like that. They argue that if you're going to fail without government intervention, you should be bound to certain rules for accepting the support.

An even further-left condition of these bailouts is equity. If you'd like to read more about this approach, the People's Policy Project has a great write-up on it here: [How To Think About Corporate Bailouts Correctly][ppp]
