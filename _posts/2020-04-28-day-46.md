## Peak Birthday Season

Birthday season rolls on as today is my birthday. Before I go into how the day went I wanted to highlight some shenanigans from last weekend where we partook in back-to-back zoom get togethers.

### Saturday Night Socializing

My family had another Zoom Codenames session planned with a later start time than the previous iteration to make it easier on participants that have strict dinner/bedtimes for small children.

The start time did creep earlier as Saturday night approached and we had an especially grueling week so for the second time we joined as spectators. Yet again, the turnout was great with appearances from my brother and Uncle Jerry. I also brought new Zoom skills to the party by playing YouTube videos as my background.

Shortly before the Codenames started, I received an invite for another happy hour from my good friend John. His birthday was coming up as well so we said our goodbyes to my family and switched over to his Zoom.

This second Zoom was more of a pure hang-out. Guests were coming and going as the night went on but everyone was asked the same three questions:

1. What are you drinking? (2015 Dark Lord)
2. When was the last time you showered? (It was the preceding Friday morning)
3. How is your mental state? (Not great)

As mentioned above, I started with a 2015 Dark Lord as it had been 5 years to the day since I purchased the beer. Well at 15%, it brought me up to a buzzed state quickly. That was the last beer I drank of the night but not the last alcoholic beverage by a long shot.

After joining the happy hour at around 7:30, we were still going well after midnight. By that point I had added gin, bourbon and scotch to the drink tally and I think the most accurate term for the level of drunk I was would be _blind_ drunk.

Rachel had retired at a much more reasonable hour and eventually emerged from the bedroom to cut me off and end the fun. Apparently I had been ranting, probably about healthcare.

In any case, I had a great time but I don't think I've ever had a worse hangover in my whole life.

### My Birthday

I'm not a multi-day birthday type of guy but my celebrations officially kicked off on Sunday when Rachel's parents delivered a pound cake and my parents dropped by to visit and deliver food and beer to help celebrate. I was still too hungover to enjoy any of it the day of but we've happily gobbled up the edible gifts as the week started.

On Monday, Rachel surprised me with some beer from our favorite local beer shop Beermiscuous. I have been talking about ordering beer from them for weeks now but worried it wouldn't be possible because we were a couple blocks outside of their delivery territory. Beermiscuous made an exception and I couldn't be happier with the surprise.

Today started out like a normal day where I isolated myself in the bedroom all morning trying to get work done. Rachel wanted to throw me a birthday party over lunch so once I finished work, we went on a family walk out to Wrigley to pick up some pizzas from Happy Camper.

The weather was beautiful and perfect for a walk. I wanted to wear my Canadian Tux, complete with a denim face mask and Rachel snapped a shot of me in the getup near the Wrigley bleachers.

After eating our pizzas I took over for Oscar duty where he treated me to not going down for his nap and forcing me to let him sleep on my shoulder for 45 minutes. Can't have it all your way on your birthday I guess.

For dinner, I wanted to support another local business so we ordered pick-up from the Bar on Buena. Even though they had a taco special for Tuesday we both opted for burgers.

We were an episode behind on the great _The Last Dance_ documentary so we fired that up and watched that during dinner. Overall, a great birthday dinner.

## Oscar Updates

Oscar is getting better and better at walking. He still prefers crawling as his primary form of locomotion but he's trying to independently walk more and more. We're trying to teach him how to stand-up on his own without any supports as we've only observed him do that once.

As mentioned above, he's not falling asleep as easily aas he has in the past. He'll chatter for 5-10 minutes after we put him down which makes naptime a lot more stressful and make bedtime more difficult if we plan on eating dinner after putting him down. More dinners in the living room for us!

## Things Cooked

I did the grocery run this past week where I loaded up on Chicken Thighs, a favorite in our house. I chose Chef John's [Rusty Chicken Thighs](https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2012/06/rusty-chicken-thighs-whats-in-name.html) recipe and grilled them up on a rainy Saturday night.

If you're a Chicken Breast person I recommend giving thighs a shot. They're much tastier and much more forgiving to cook. You can overcook them and they'll still taste great.
