Now, I'm not a big follower of the president (in either a positive or negative sense) but the sentiment he's sharing here is strikingly similar to what's currently going down in the book I'm reading, [The Dispossessed][dispossessed].

I'm around 60% through the book and at this particular moment in the story the protagonist and his community are dealing with a major drought.
