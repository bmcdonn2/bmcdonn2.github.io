## Birthday Season Commences

March 24th is a big day in the McDonnell family because it marks the dual birthdays of Mary Kate and Jack! As is the latest fashion, we took our celebration to Zoom.

Once we had everyone on the line, we attempted a quick rendition of "Happy Birthday" which brought Oscar to tears due to the shear beauty of our singing voices. 

The rest of the session went well. Mary Kate got to show off her pretzel birthday cakes. Jack got to show off his view. My parents got to show off their shamrock snowman. I got to show off Steven the Sourdough starter. There was something for everyone.

### Illness Update

I'm feeling much better today but still not 100%. I was well enough to handle my Oscar shift this afternoon but boy did it take it out of me.

## Oscar Update

Outside of the video chat with the McDonnell clan, the other major Oscar story was that he added two new items to his "Ok, I'll eat that" list: Strawberries and Grapes. He's already familiar with the flavors through mix-ins we add to his yogurt but today he tried the real thing and it impressed him enough that he had more than one bite.

## Things Cooked

Just another feeding for Steven the sourdough starter. I did transfer the starter to a new vessel to track the activity. The starter should be ready when it doubles in size 2-3 hours after a feeding. Today it passed that test. Sourdough bread incoming!

## Odds & Ends

Some sad news for the small business corridor we call home, PR Italian is officially closed until this crisis passes. Their last night of service was this previous Sunday and Monday they boarded up the place.

Their social media posts promise that they "look forward to seeing us on the other side" and I'll say the feeling is mutual.
