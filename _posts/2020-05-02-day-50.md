## Taking Our Talents to the Suburbs

> In this May... this is very tough... in this May we're going to take our talents to the Suburbs and join my parents. We feel like it's going to give us the best opportunity to win and to win for multiple weeks, and not only just to win the work week or just to win warm days or cold days, we want to be able to win all days. And we feel like we can compete out there.

Yes, we've made our [_Decision_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTeCc8jy7FI) to move in with my parents for the near future given the pandemic. This was not an easy choice to make but given the option and our current situation it was one we felt we had to make.

We officially hatched our plan last Sunday, my parents kindly dropped off a car during the monsoon that was Wednesday and we packed up and left on Friday.

Things are off to a good start so far. My old room is now my mom's office but Oscar now occupies Jack's old room and we've taken over MK's spot.

### Last-minute Chore

One task I've been meaning to complete for a long while now is repairing some of my jeans. This might seem like an odd item on the to-do list but I've become a bit of a raw denim guy the past couple of years (thanks [Heddels](https://www.heddels.com/2011/09/the-essential-raw-denim-breakdown-our-100th-article/)) and the first pair of raws that I bought in the summer of 2018 were starting to wear down in the crotch.

As fortune would have it, Rachel added a sewing machine to our wedding registry back in 2017 meaning we've had one traveling with us ever since from apartment, to apartment to condo. These days it mainly does its job of occupying space in Oscar's closet.

Well, the machine had rested long enough so I started it up and gave my jeans a good darning (thanks again [Heddels](https://www.heddels.com/2012/10/how-to-a-simple-guide-to-diy-denim-repairs/)).

Not bad for a guy that didn't start wearing jeans until he was a couple years out of college.

## Oscar Updates

Oscar had his 15-month check-up on Thursday but pandemic rules prevented both parents from joining and I was the odd-man out. I dropped of the mother-son duo, stopped by Dark Matter then found a parking spot in front of our old spot on Nelson and then called-in on speaker phone to the appointment.

As far as the move to the suburbs went, Oscar's adjusted surprisingly well. We assumed he'd have trouble sleeping at the start but he slept the whole first night without a peep. He's loved his time with his grandparents.

Mere hours after we made our plans last Sunday, Oscar's Aunt MK ordered a special gift to be delivered to the grandparents house: a slide!. So far Oscar's a little hesitant to try it out but he had plenty of chances in today's great weather.

In the afternoon we went on a long walk down to KLM and Oscar was a pretty good sport considering how he favors bustling city streets to peaceful tree-lined ones (at least as far as we've observed given his general dislike of walking through Graceland cemetary, but maybe he's just not a cemetary guy).

When we returned Oscar did get a chance to see one of his favorite things up close: a big white truck. His grandparents had a new washer and dryer delivered and Oscar carefully observed the whole process of unloading new appliances and loading the old ones onto the big truck.

Tomorrow looks to be another nice day, then comes the real test of the work week!

## Things Cooked

I've got another sourdough loaf in the works right now. This'll be my first time using a real _banneton_ (shout out to MK for the birthday gift) so we'll see how it goes. When I fed the starter today for the first time in the suburbs I saw massive activity.

I'm also going to try a different recipe this time so stay tuned.
