One week ends and another begins.

## Housekeeping

Apologies for the lack of updates. Looking back, I can't believe I updated this blog once a day! I think going forward a more reasonable content-frequency will be 1-2 times a week. Staying inside all day inherently brings with it a lack of _stuff_ happening from day-to-day if you're not covering current events.

Speaking of current events, I made an effort to cover those in my earlier posts and from now on I'm going to try my best to avoid them during normal updates. Instead, I'm planning on writing standalone news/politics-centric posts so stay tuned!

## Books

I finished _The Dispossessed_ on Thursday night. I'm not one to apply ratings to books (or really anything) but I can say that I enjoyed it. I wouldn't call it a page-turner but it certainly makes you think. If you've ever wondered what an Anarchist society might look like, I recommend it wholeheartedly.

Continuing with the Anarchism theme, I've moved on to one of the inspirations for _The Dispossessed_: Peter Kropotkin's [_The Conquest of Bread_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread). At the present, I'm about 20% through the book and you can see how Kropotkin influenced Le Guin (though Le Guin specifically mentions his _Mutual Aid_ as an influence rather than _The Conquest of Bread_).

In either case, I plan on alternating between fiction and nonfiction for future readings. I'm hoping the backlog I've built up with the help of [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/) will be more than enough to serve me throughout this pandemic.

If you want to follow along with what I'm reading, I've added my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65547471-brian-mcdonnell) profile to my list of links.

## Party Time

Our friends Pat & Jen are theme-party enthusiasts in the best possible way. Their two longest-running theme-parties are for Christmas and Shark Week. When they got wind of a special Shark Week Weekend this weekend, they quickly organized a virtual Shark Week party to help celebrate.

A common aspect of the annual Shark Week party is watching a **bad** Shark movie. This has included hits like _Deep Blue Sea_ and more obscure films like _Snow Sharks_. For the virtual get together 1987's _Jaws: The Revenge_ was the choice.

This was the fourth and final entry in the _Jaws_ franchise and it fits in the **bad** movie category. The one redeeming factor of the film was Michael Caine's participation as the beloved "Hoagie".

It was the perfect choice for the gathering. Turnout was around ~20 people and we had great fun in the text chat while watching the movie. The only disappointment of the night was the lack of body-count in the movie itself.

This was also the night that I decided to figure out how backgrounds work in Zoom. I tried my best to get into the Shark Week spirit!

## Oscar Update

Oscar's still working at the walking. I'd say today, Sunday, was his best day so far. He's been more willing to risk walking a few steps on his own.

On the food front, he's made his first good attempt at chicken fries. We've been offering them for a while but on Saturday he actually put one in his mouth and chewed for a while. If we can get him eating these it'll be his first real non-spoonfed protein.

One goofy thing he's been up to as of late is wanting to drink from _my_ cup. As I'm making an effort to drink as much water as possible I often have a water cup nearby that he demands access to. Anyway, on Thursday I granted his request but forced him to drink out of his own cup embedded inside my cup:

## Things Cooked

I made a second go at sourdough bread this weekend following a much more involved process detailed here:

As somebody that enjoys recipes with more steps, this new approach was appealing.

The results were much better this time. As you can see, it had a great color and a much more open crumb structure.

There are definitely a couple of areas for improvement:

1. Cutting the "ear". In my first attempt I used a sharp knife which was less effective on my second attempt because the dough was softer.
2. Find an improved proofing basket. My first attempts used a colander with a tapioca-flour dusted towel as a liner. In future loaves I want something more akin to a true banneton. Maybe a birthday gift idea?

Other than the bread, I made one of our staple pressure cooker meals the other night: [Chicken, Lentil & Bacon Stew][se-stew]. Normally, I try to dork this one up a bit by cooking the bacon and onions in a separate pan to help build up a fond then deglaze. This time I was lazy and did it all in one pot and it was still delicious.
