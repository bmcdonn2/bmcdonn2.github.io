## Weekend Update

The illness thats been dogging me all week came back with more force on Friday night into Saturday. The symptoms are still mild but even the most mild symptoms combined with chasing around a toddler are enough to force regular naps.

Birthday season is in full effect as yesterday was my dad's birthday. We had a grandparents **only** Zoom setup before joining a larger full-family Zoom later in the afternoon. I think we're all starting to get a good feel for Zoom at this point and some folks are starting to get into the more advanced features like changing backgrounds.

We decided to join in with the latest streaming fad and start Tiger King this weekend. We'll be through the first four episodes before Sunday night ends. Full review eventually if I feel like it. 

## Oscar Update

Big news for Oscar on Saturday as we witnessed his first independent steps. Previous unassisted attempts came with plenty of cajoling from Rachel and me but we can say with certainty that Saturday's steps were 100% his idea.

I've tried my best to recreate the scene in a diagram:

I was sitting near the window and Rachel was near the spinning chair. Oscar was cruising along the bench in front of the TV stand when he decided to take a couple of steps to the coffee table. And that's the milestone!

## Things Cooked

Folks, this was the weekend I tried to turn that sourdough starter into a loaf of bread and I regret to inform you the results were suboptimal.

The structure wasn't great, the color wasn't good. I was disappointed. The goods news is I still have plenty of starter left and I've got couple of alternative recipes to try. Stay tuned!

To make myself feel better I made some Peanut Butter Fudge. Hard to mess up a combination of Peanut Butter, Butter, and Sugar. It tasted good, if a little sweet.
