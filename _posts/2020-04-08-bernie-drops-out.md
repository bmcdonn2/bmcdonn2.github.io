Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Democratic Primary today. That effectively ends the primary itself and sets up a highly anticipated Trump vs. Biden match-up ðŸ¤¢.

## My Candidate

I made a post on Facebook about a month ago expressing my support for Bernie. If you missed it, here it is:

Until then, I had always made an effort to keep my true political views private. In some respects, I had done such a good job of concealing my true feelings that some folks thought I was joking. I'll admit, the goofy head shot and title were an attempt to feed that idea of a joke to provide a little cover from some of my, shall I say, more politically _engaged_ connections.

But it was not a joke. Everything about that image is true. I wrote the text. I phone banked for Bernie. I even knocked on doors for Bernie. Here's the button I got for canvassing!

Why would I go through all of this? Well, I thought I'd be a mostly apolitical person my whole life but Bernie changed that. The fact that he changed that is what compelled me to get involved and go public. I have no regrets.

## It's About Policy

I'm not going to go into my full political evolution here (I'm saving that for another post!), but the reason I supported Bernie over everyone else was simple, it was his policies.

Or more accurately, the policies I supported are the ones that Bernie chose to champion in his campaign. I think this is an important distinction.

The idea of a policy _belonging_ to a candidate can imply a deep coupling whereby if the candidate is eliminated, so is that policy. On the flip side, if there is an established movement supporting a policy and a candidate adopts that policy, even if the candidate ends their campaign, the movement survives.

The clearest example of this to me (and my pet issue), is the idea of Medicare For All. Yes, Bernie _"wrote the damn bill"_, but there are activist groups out there fighting for that bill. Those same groups pushed Bernie to include additional provisions in his bill like the inclusion of long-term care. The end of Bernie does not mean the end of Medicare for All.

## An Escape from Trump

Another reason I found myself drawn to Bernie is because the conversation he pushed rarely centered around Trump. If, during a debate for instance, the moderator asked about Trump, Bernie would drop his canned line about how Trump is a "pathological liar..." and then pivot to an answer of actual substance.

His focus on offering a positive alternative to the current world we live in was, to me, a much more satisfying approach to win the presidency than merely enumerating all the ways that Trump is bad.

I'll admit I consumed a lot of that "orange man bad" content in 2016 and 2017 but looking back it felt empty. Was I going to let my politics be defined by opposition to a single man? What happens when Trump is no longer in the picture? 

Anyway, back then Bernie wasn't even running but the remnants of his 2016 campaign were still active and they scooped me up. I haven't looked back since.

## The Campaign is Dead

Long live the movement.

Ever since the country's been in lockdown, I felt it inevitable that Bernie would end his campaign. He relied on energy and crowds and organizing and the power of those things is greatly diminished when nobody is supposed to leave their house. You can only go so far with social media livestreams.

But while Bernie is no longer in it, I take comfort in the idea that he did _build_ a movement and that that movement is not going anywhere. It isn't going anywhere because the problems it seeks to solve are still there. In this time of pandemic, those problems are becoming even more dire and difficult to ignore.

It's funny, in 2016 I remember thinking that this darn election just needed to be over so I could stop thinking about Trump. I was so certain that if he lost, he and his supporters would simply disappear. We'll never know what would have happened if he lost but we already know that this time, in 2020, Bernie lost. The one prediction I'll make this go-around is that while Bernie might fade away, there's no way his movement will.

Bernie's slogan was _Not Me, Us_ and that's the perfect encapsulation of the campaign. In the end, he lost, but that's okay because it was never about him. It was always about building a movement that will carry us all forward into a better future. The movement will survive.
