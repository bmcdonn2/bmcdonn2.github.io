First, a tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Everybody is so well unified and working so hard. It is a beautiful thing to see. They love our great Country. We will end up being stronger than ever before!</p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1239567267312152576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 16, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Now, in most cases I try to ignore the president (these days it's becoming more and more difficult) but the sentiment he's sharing here is strikingly similar to what's currently going down in the book I'm reading, [The Dispossessed][dispossessed].

I'm around 60% through the book and at this particular moment in the story the protagonist and his community are dealing with a major drought. Their society is organized quite differently from ours but the call to do hard work when hard problems arise inspires something in the people that is sometimes forgotten in less pressing times:

>The old tag of "solidarity" had come alive again. There is exhilaration in finding that the bond is stronger, after all, than all that tries the bond.[^dp]

It's this _solidarity_ that really gives me hope in these times. One important aspect of this is that it is a concept that extends beyond our borders. This pandemic is truly a global issue so while it can be dreadful to think that so many places have the same terrible disaster to handle, there is some comfort that we are all in this together.

## Oscar Update

Kiddo got to try his hand at coloring today with some crayons we acquired from Smoke Daddy about a month ago. I'd say it was overall a success as he only tried to eat the crayons a couple of times.

## Things Cooked

Nothing cooked today but I did kick-off a sourdough bread starter. As is often the case, I'm following the advice of Chef John on this one where he's described the process of creating the starter as having "the world's most boring pet".

The overall process should take 7-10 days so I'll keep everyone posted. 

For those interested, here's the Chef John video:

## Politics

Seems like the #YangGang is really having a moment right now. Lots of chatter out there about sending every single adult in this country $1000 check in the mail, no strings attached to help ease the imminent economic burden this pandemic is inducing.

You might be surprised to learn that this suggestion came from Mitt Romney, the Republican Senator from Utah. You might also be surprised that Romney is further left on this approach than most Democrats. How could this be? 

_Means testing_.

Yep, while Romney just wants to send everyone checks given the urgent dire need out there, Democrats want to _target_ the recipients. What does this entail? It means trying to create a test to see which people truly need this. 

Why is this a problem? Well what should that test be: income-based? employment-based? industry-based? Assuming we decide on parameters how do we apply the test? Build a website? Have people fill-out forms and mail them in?

The speed with which this pandemic is becoming a problem cannot wait for these types of details to be figured out.

Anyway, I'm not great at expressing my political thoughts yet in writing but this meme is a good (if vulgar) distillaiton of the means-testing vs universal approach to a social safety net.
