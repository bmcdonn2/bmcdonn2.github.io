## Youthful Ignorance

### 1992 - Clinton vs. H.W. Bush

At 5 years old, this is the first election I remember. The extent of that memory is a simple I told joke after the defeat of Bush:

> Where did George Bush go?
> He went to go hide in a bush!

### 1996 - Clinton vs. Dole

I lived in the Netherlands during this election.

### 2000 - Gore vs. W. Bush

Lockbox.

Recount.

### 2004 - Kerry vs. W. Bush

Purple hearts.

## Oh Hey, I Can Vote Now

### 2008 - Hope & Change

Obama.

### 2012 - ???

Apathy.

## 2016
