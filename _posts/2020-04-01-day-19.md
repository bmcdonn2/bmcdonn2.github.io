Welcome to April. Months in general haven't been doing too well in 2020 so let's see how April fairs. It's always been my favorite month so it's got that going for it at least.

## Tiger King Recap

We finished up the Tiger King last night and it's as wild as everyone says. Here are my tiers of the folks featured in the show from least terrible to most terrible.

### Okay/Good Tier

These are folks that I think are generally okay. All are directly linked with Joe which implies animal abuse but I truly think they cared for the animals and were trying their best.

* The lady that got her arm bitten off
* The guy that lost both his legs in a zip-line accident
* Joe's campaign manager
* Joe's park manager guy that had the long blond hair
* Joe's new husband
* Joe's first husband

### Joe Tier

I'm rating Joe between the good and the bad.

As the founder of a private zoo and trader of big cats, he's got some serious bad aspects to him. I think one of the final scenes demonstrates how he may have had noble goals when he first started the park and how they degraded into nothing by the end.

There's the whole wanting-to-kill-Carol thing as well. I believe he was never serious about it.

Keeping his husbands drugged up was also bad. That video with him complaining about the N-word was bad.

But still, I can't put him in the bad tier. I think it's a lack of pure malevolence or cold calculating evil that I see in the others. I also believe he was setup. His quick pivot to selling out all the others to PETA was neat too.

I'm surprised I'm putting him here to be honest. While watching this series I remember thinking he was one of the most irredeemable people I'd ever seen but by the end, I'd changed my mind. Could be that the show-creator was very effective in making Joe sympathetic.

* Joe Exotic

### Bad Tier

These people are bad.

* That chucky lookin' guy that rode the jetski
* Carol's husband
* Joe's Producer
* That guy from Illinois that Jeff screwed over at the end
* Jeff's current wife

### Terrible Tier

These people are worse than bad, they are terrible.

* Doc
* Carol
* Jeff's lackey wannabe-hitman guy

### No-redeeming-qualities Tier

This is a special tier for Jeff, who is the worst.

* Jeff

## Oscar Update

Not much new news since the first steps over the weekend. Progress on the walking remains slow, not much change since Sunday. Like most things, Oscar is getting to it in his own time.

One Oscar related change we've imposed this week is alternating the morning/afternoon schedule. I took Oscar in the morning for the first time on Monday and it wasn't that bad! I'll admit to feeling a lot more drained in the afternoon but am hopeful that'll fade as I become more acclimated to the morning stretches.

## Things Cooked

We're in full Rice and Beans mode here. I couldn't resist giving Chef John's latest pandemic friendly recipe a try, [The Best Baked Rice & Beans][fw-rice]. I diverged from the Chef John recipe by swapping the canned beans for dried beans cooked in a pressure cooker (because of course I did) and I can't recommend the substitution enough.

Here's the finished product, adorned with a bit of shredded colby-jack.

Not the prettiest dish but tasty. Which is a good thing because I'll be eating this all week.
