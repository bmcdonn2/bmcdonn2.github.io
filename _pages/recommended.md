This is a collection of things I recommend. 

## Podcasts

Podcasts make commutes enjoyable. If my commute was a bit longer or had more of guarantee in me procuring a seat, maybe it'd be books for me. Alas, that's not the case so its Podcasts all the way.

### [Revolutions](https://www.revolutionspodcast.com/)

My go-to history podcast. I first heard about this one because its creator, Mike Duncan, was a guest on one of my other favorite podcasts. This was my main commute podcast until I caught up to new episodes and now I'm stuck waiting for a new one each week.

This podcast follows these political revolutions:

* English Revolution
* American Revolution
* French Revolution
* Haitian Revolution
* Spanish American wars of independence
* The French July Revolution
* Revolutions of 1848
* Paris Commune
* Mexican Revolution
* Russian Revolution - In Progress, also the final revolution covered in the series

It's a truly fascinating crawl through history and if you have an interest, I suggest starting at the beginning with the English Revolution. 

I will warn you that in retrospect that first revolution was one of the harder ones to follow but do persevere. Once you hit the familiar setting of the American Revolution you'll be ready to churn through these.

My favorite revolutions were the French and Mexican but I would like to make a special mention of the Haitian revolution given it's lack of coverage in most history curriculums.

### [Citations Needed](https://citationsneeded.libsyn.com/)

From the About section of the podcast:

>Citations Needed is a podcast about the intersection of media, PR, and power, hosted by Nima Shirazi and Adam Johnson.

Each episode of this tidily covers a topic about the media whether that be a [critique of the concept of "Purity Politics"][cn-purity], [a discussion of the overuse of the term "Middle Class"][cn-middle] or the [ineffectiveness of "Hypocrisy" takedowns][cn-hypocrisy].

The sample episode I'm sharing here is the one that introduced me to the show. Its subject is "crime reporting" and profoundly changed how I think about law enforcement media like police blotters and mug shot releases.

This episode had me hooked and now this series is my go-to one-off podcast when I'm on a trip or waiting for a fresh episode from my weekly series.

## Cooking

I like cooking, here's where I get 95% of my recipes.

### [Foodwishes](https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/)

I first heard about Chef John when he made an informative video about how to eat a chicken wing. This was a significant moment in my life because until that point I never liked chicken wings all that much.

That was not the only influence Chef John had on my life, not by a long shot. His Foodwishes blog has influenced my cooking more than anything else. if I had to estimate, I think I've made over 60 of his recipes. I still make a modified version of his Greek Chicken nearly every week.

This is the first recipe I ever made and I haven't looked back since.

### [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/)

I think my fist interaction with Serious Eats was either the [Burger Lab][se-burger] or the [Science of the Best Chocolate Chip Cookies][se-cookie]. Both were projects spearheaded by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt and my main gateway to the rest of Serious Eats.

I originally stayed true to Kenji but as time went on I found most contributors had quality recipes.

This site is one of my go-to places for pressure cooker recipes as well.

### [ChefSteps](https://www.chefsteps.com/)

I'll admit it that ChefSteps ain't what it used to be but that's okay. It's still a site heavily devoted to a scientific approach to cooking which is why it's still on the list. 

They've inspired me to acquire some ridiculous cooking equipment (a whipping siphon?!) but their sous vide guides and commitment to presenting recipes in weight measurements (**grams!**) and temperatures is a standard I wish more cooking websites would follow.

Why do I think they've jumped the shark? Most of their new content is either directly hidden behind a paywall or uses ingredients hidden behind that same paywall. I get it, they need to make money, but it's tough to see all the paid content when it used to be free.

Anyway, here's the most recent recipe I've made from them:

(Yes, I did buy the Glycerol monostearate they recommend using in this recipe.)
