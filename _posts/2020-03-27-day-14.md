Happy Friday y'all! Apologies for lack of daily posts. It's amazing how much time it takes to write these!

The reason for the lack of posts these last couple of days is that I added a new section to the site. I'm calling it _Recommended_ and it's a list of things I like. In its initial iteration it only covers podcasts and cooking sites. I plan on expanding it over time so be sure to check it from time to time. 

Here's a [direct link](/recommended/) if you're having trouble finding it in the nav bar (for those accessing the site on mobile you can find the navigation in the "burger" menu).

## Oscar Update

The little man completed his second complete work week at home without missing a beat. Today he tried waffles for the first time and while I did not witness it firsthand, I was told he had a few bites. We'll take a few bits over throwing everything on the floor.

Later this afternoon Oscar joined me on my company's first weekly virtual beer Friday. Once connected to the Zoom meeting, I let Oscar have free control of the keyboard. I'll tell you what, he was able to change settings I didn't even know existed. 

Luckily, Oscar managed to capture a screenshot from the experience. I present it here:

(You can spot Oscar in the top row, second column. His noggin took up the entire camera frame.)

## Things Cooked

This is a bit of a strange one. I'm planning on making that Sourdough bread this weekend and in preparation I've watched more YouTube videos (beyond the Foodwishes recipe _gasp!_) in hopes of learning more tricks. 

One video made mention of how once you have an active starter, it isn't necessary to discard half of it during feedings. In fact, you could fry up the dough and it yields a tasty snack.

I've tried this the past two days and can report that I've suffered no ill effects and I think it's pretty tasty. For the record, Rachel thinks it's very un-tasty. More for me.

Here's what it looks like:

And here's where I got the idea from: [15 Mistakes Most Beginning Sourdough Bakers Make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJEHsvW2J6M)

Stay safe!
