Happy St. Patrick's Day! You may notice that the home page is a little more fleshed out now with the addition of a header image and nav bar. I also added a list of recipes I've made since starting the blog.

While I did start this blog as a sort of pandemic diary, it's been a goal of mine to start one for some time. The blog itself is hosted on [GitHub pages][pages] and uses the [Jekyll][jekyll] framework which conforms to [Jamstack][jamstack] principles. 

## Oscar Update

Tried to get the little man to use a spoon and feed himself this morning for breakfast. Pretty sure he got more yogurt on his face than in his mouth.

## Things Cooked

Kept feeding my sourdough starter. Definitely had some funky smell to it when I checked on it today.

I made also dough for some [Lebanese Mountain Bread][bread]. We've got a lot of leftover hummus from the weekend due to Rachel's book club being moved to a Google hangout so figured this would be a good accompaniment along with some chicken kebabs.

## Politics

Today was also election day in Illinois. The polls closed a couple of hours ago and it looks like Bernie is getting creamed by old man Biden which is disappointing. 

I'm not sure where Bernie goes from here but even if this is the beginning of the end, he was the first candidate that I ever felt I both had a good understanding of and was excited to vote for. He helped me to really look beyond the surface-level of politics and really dig into policy and how to build power.

In more positive news, it looks like Marie Newman might finally dislodge Lipinski, so not all bad.

Anyway, if I keep writing about politics every day expect more on this as the primary season chugs along in parallel with this pandemic.

Stay Safe!
