## Long Days and Pleasant Nights

This past week was not an easy one. Rachel and I are both increasingly busy with work which on its own would be enough for a stressful week. Add-on the full time care of a toddler and a dreadful week of weather (for mid-April) and that stress multiplies.

I think it was the weather that really took it out of us. We have come to rely on long walks with Oscar to help pass time and cold/snowy weather makes that very difficult. Oscar himself has also developed an expectation of outdoors excursions. He'll often grab his shoes or coat and bring them to us before standing next to the door, pointing at the door knob.

Still, despite the rough days we always have 2-3 hours to recover at night. Our current go-to show to unwind to is [_Happy Endings_][happy-endings]. I think it's worthy of a more in-depth review so look forward to that some day soon.

Outside of those much-needed couch potato nights, we've found other forms of evening entertainment.

### Highlander Watch Party

We hatched the idea to watch Highlander on Good Friday during our virtual fish and chips get together. I don't know how we got on the topic, but of the dozen people at the Good Friday event, I was one of the few who had seen the movie.

This was the same crew that we watched the notorious Jaws 4 with so I knew it'd be a perfect audience for Highlander. I think all I needed to sell the film was that Sean Connery plays a two-thousand year-old Egyptian Spanish man and that Queen did most of the soundtrack.

The watch party was almost derailed when our host's _obtained_ copy had a runtime of only one hour and seven minutes, which I knew to be short. Luckily for us, the whole movie is on YouTube so we plugged that into a browser extension named [Metastream][meta-stream] and had ourselves a fun two-hours. I even cracked open a barrel-aged Scottish Wee Heavy for the occasion.

### Carcassonne Game Night

When the idea of shelter in place first came about, one of Rachel's first suggestions was that we play Carcassonne. Well, 36 days later her wish (finally) came true.

I wired in Spotify through the TV and put on the latest albums by [Thundercat][thundercat] and [Yves Tumor][yves] and we got started, me in blue her in green.

It'd been a while since we last played so we were both a bit rusty. If we had any strategy I'd say I was more road-centric while Rachel was more farm centric. In the end, my roads won out over her farms and I won by 7.

### Family Codenames

The McDonnell & Graham families have had a recent tradition on holidays to play the game [Codenames][codenames]. Given the popularity of the game in the family, we thought it'd be fun to play digitally so we gave it a shot this Sunday.

The chosen time was early evening which doesn't quite work for our dinner/bedtime schedule with Oscar. Still, we joined the Zoom as spectators and had a great time.

I had two cameras going, one on the laptop, the other on our tablet. I also got to show-off my new skills at changing my background. By the end of the session I loaded up a gif of MJ dunking on somebody in preparation for the new MJ documentary premier tonight.

We're going to try and plan the next session for after Oscar's bedtime so we can fully participate next time.

## Oscar Updates

Not much to report on in the past week. The little man has gotten much better at eating chicken fries and is gaining more confidence every day in taking steps.

## Things Cooked

Our Easter feast lasted us all the way to Thursday when we polished off the last of the mashed potatoes. Of course, mashed potatoes does not a meal make so we paired it with some sous vide pork loin[^1] and some roasted broccoli. For the roasted broccoli, I followed [this great recipe][broccoli] which calls for high heat and cooking until the broccoli looks near-burnt. Be not afraid of the charred appearance, it's a delicious broccoli preparation and I highly recommend it.

On Saturday, I lugged the pressure cooker out of storage to first cook some dried chickpeas and then to cook a modified version [Chicken & Chickpea Masala][chickend-chickpea]. The main modifications were:

* Swapping frozen spinach for fresh, 
* Swapping white wine vinegar for lemon juice
* Swapping coconut milk for heavy cream
* Omitting the cilantro entirely

The adjustments, of course, being the result of our desire to minimize grocery store visits and using what was on hand. 

We had a large yield on the masala so that should keep us fed for the next few days. It's a good thing I'm a pro at eating the same thing day after day ðŸ˜‰

We also ended up with some extra cooked chickpeas so there's a good chance I combine them with some tahini later this week to make hummus. The main ingredient I'm missing is lemon. In this case I will _not_ substitute vinegar.

Finally, on Sunday I made a third loaf of sourdough. I followed the same approach as loaf #2 and the results appear to be the same. Overall, pretty good but an overly open crumb structure.

[^1]: No specific recipe here. It's just a matter of purchasing one of those shrink-wrapped, pre-seasoned pork loins and plopping it in the sous vide for 2-3 hours.
