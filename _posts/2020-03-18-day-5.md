There's a quote from Fred Hampton I've been thinking about all day. You may have heard it before:

>We don't think you fight fire with fire best; we think you fight fire with water best. **We're going to fight racism not with racism, but we're going to fight with solidarity.**[^fh]

Why have I been thinking of this quote? Well, it seems that certain people in power have decided that it might be a good idea to try and cast blame for this global pandemic on China.

Did the virus originate there? Yes.

Is it necessary to name it after China (or Wuhan)? No.

This is especially true because we already have decided on a terms for this thing: _coronavirus_ or _COVID-19_. I mean, look at the Google Trends comparing the terms:

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/2152_RC02/embed_loader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"Chinese virus","geo":"US","time":"2020-01-15 2020-03-18"},{"keyword":"wuhan virus","geo":"US","time":"2020-01-15 2020-03-18"},{"keyword":"/m/01cpyy","geo":"US","time":"2020-01-15 2020-03-18"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"date=2020-01-15%202020-03-18&geo=US&q=Chinese%20virus,wuhan%20virus,%2Fm%2F01cpyy","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); </script>

Clearly we've decided on a name for this thing and we decided on it long ago.

This is why it is difficult to read these attempts at renaming the virus as anything other than bad faith attempts to shift blame. And really, who does this even serve? We have a global-scale problem to solve, what use is it to alienate potential allies?

I think that is why the quote has been floating through my head. It is a reminder that anytime racism rears its ugly head and adds fuel to an already blazing fire, the idea of solidarity can combat it head-on.

If you'd like to learn more about Fred Hampton, I recommend giving a listen to this episode of The Dollop (though you might find yourself very angry after listening to it):

## Oscar Update

We took Google Hangouts for a spin today to help get some face time with the little man's Grandparents and Aunt MK. It was a good trial run but we're still looking to make some tweaks.

For example, the default behavior of Hangouts is to display the speaker on the main video and relegate everyone else to small thumbnails. You'd might not be surprised to learn that this isn't that intuitive for a 14-month old.

In the world of food, we offered chicken tenders for the first time at lunch. Oscar was not a fan. His mom thinks it might be the preparation method as microwaving them seemed to leave them bone dry.

At dinner we did have some success in offering the flatbread I made. He had a few bites which is a rare but welcome result for new foods.

## Things Cooked

Today was a bit more active than previous days on the cooking front. I took the Lebanese Mountain Bread dough from yesterday and used it to make the final product today. Turned out quite well though I think I'll need to work on my kneading technique as there were a few tears while I stretched it.

To pair with the bread, I made Chef John's "Turkish" Chicken Kebabs. This is dish is quickly finding itself part of the normal rotation as grilling season is upon us. This of course assumes that chicken will remain easily available of which there seems to be no guarantees in a pandemic.

To round out the meal, I served the meat and bread with a nice dollop of hummus, slices of tomatoes and a lemon wedge. Normally I'd like a bit of greenery on the plate in the form of cucumbers but the Jewel was fresh out when Rachel made a grocery run last night.
